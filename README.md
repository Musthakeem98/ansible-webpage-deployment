# ansible-webpage-deployment
This repository contains an Ansible playbook that automates the deployment of a simple webpage on a remote server. The playbook sets up the necessary configurations, installs Apache web server, and copies an index.html file with a "Welcome to My Webpage!" message to the appropriate directory on the server.
